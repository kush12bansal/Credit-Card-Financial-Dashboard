## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow

The dashboard's data pipeline is structured to handle weekly updates:

1.  **Initial Data Setup (SQL):** The initial database schema was created using SQL. The `COPY` command was then used to ingest the foundational dataset from the original CSV files (`credit_card.csv`, `customer.csv`).
2.  **Live Performance Simulation:** To demonstrate the dashboard's capability for live tracking, new weekly data was programmatically added to the database. This simulates a real-world scenario where new transactions and customer information are continuously fed into the system.
3.  **Dynamic Modeling (DAX):** The data was modeled in Power BI. DAX was crucial for creating time-intelligence calculations essential for a weekly report, such as **Week-over-Week (WoW) growth** and other dynamic measures.
4.  **Dashboard Visualization:** An interactive dashboard was built to present the weekly findings, allowing stakeholders to easily monitor performance and drill down into specific metrics.
