## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow

The project was executed following a standard data analysis workflow:

1.  **Data Ingestion:** Raw data from CSV files (`credit_card.csv`, `customer.csv`) was loaded into a PostgreSQL database.
2.  **Data Transformation with SQL:** SQL commands were used to perform essential ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes. This involved joining the credit card and customer tables to create a unified view for analysis.
3.  **Modeling with DAX:** The cleaned data was imported into Power BI. DAX queries were then written to create key business metrics, such as `Total Revenue`, `Total Interest`, and time-intelligence functions for weekly and quarterly comparisons.
4.  **Dashboard Visualization:** An interactive dashboard was designed to present the findings, allowing for easy exploration of data through various demographic and transactional filters.
